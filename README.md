Hi, Iâ€™m Preethi! I work on Data Analytics and love digging into data to make sense of it. Over the years, I have gained solid experience in analytics, ETL and business intelligence and I really enjoy using SQL, Python, and Power BI to build dashboards, streamline pipelines and uncover insights that help guide decisions.

Most of my projects involve cleaning, transforming and visualizing data to solve real-world problems. I have worked with large datasets across industries and find it rewarding to turn complex information into clear, actionable results.

In my free time, I like experimenting with new data tools and techniques, always looking for ways to expand my skills.

This repository is my space to showcase skills, share projects and track my journey in data analytics.
